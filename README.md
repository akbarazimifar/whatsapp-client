## Disclaimer
I can't guarantee you will not be blocked by using this method, although it has worked for me. WhatsApp does not allow bots or unofficial clients on their platform, so this shouldn't be considered totally safe.

Use this project as it functions, do not use this application for illegal activities or outside the [Terms of Service](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/updates/terms-of-service/?lang=en) of WhatsApp.
